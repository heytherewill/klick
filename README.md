 This repository contains my personal keybindings for [The Key Macropad](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/)
 
 ## Usage
 
Follow the [official instructions](https://drop.com/talk/93641/how-to-configure-stack-overflow-the-key-macropad) on how to flash custom firmware in your macropad. You can find the firmware I'm currently using in the [`Firmware`](https://github.com/heytherewill/klick/tree/main/Firmware) folder. Said firmware is based on the one from [this repo](https://github.com/shantanuraj/keeb-go/blob/main/resources/f17-18-19-mod-shift.hex).
 
Once done, compile the program using `./gradlew :package`
